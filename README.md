# WEB2 Frontend
This project is a React-based frontend that is integrated with a custom backend. The backend can be found on GitHub at [WE2Backend](https://github.com/sarahcorvinus/WE2Backend). It also provides demo data if the backend is not actively running in the background so that one can evaluate how the frontend works.

It was created as part of the ‘Web Engineering 2’ course at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences (BHT).
